2.	Write a program that prompts the user to enter a pointer to an object of a certain class and then converts it to a pointer to an object of a different class using the const_cast operator.
    The program should then display the original pointer and the converted pointer to the user.
    
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

class base
{
public:
    const int x=90;
    void output1()
    {
        cout<<"x: "<<x<<endl;
    }
};
class derived : public base
{
public:
    int y=900;
    void output2()
    {
        cout<<"y: "<<y<<endl;
    }
};

int main()
{
    base obb;
    derived obd;
    derived *obd2;
    obd2 = &obd;
    int *ptr = const_cast <int *>(obd2);
    obd2->output1();
    obd2->output2();
}
