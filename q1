1.	Write a program that prompts the user to enter a character and then converts it to an integer using the dynamic_cast operator.
        The program should then display the original character and the converted integer to the user.


#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
main()
{
    char c;
    cout<<"Enter the value: "<<endl;
    cin>>c;
    cout<<"Original character: "<<c<<endl;
    cout<<"After changing: "<<(int)c<<endl;
}
